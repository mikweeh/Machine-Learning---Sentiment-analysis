This is the project 'Sentiment Analysis' from Udacity nanodegree 'Machine Learning Engineer'.
Fully developed and working on April 18th, 2020.


Project Overview:

Welcome to the SageMaker deployment project! In this project you will construct a __recurrent neural network (RNN)__ for the purpose of __determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set__. You will create this model using __Amazon's SageMaker service__. In addition, you will deploy your model and construct a simple __web app__ which will interact with the deployed model.


Project Instructions:

The deployment project which you will be working on is intended to be done using Amazon's SageMaker platform. In particular, it is assumed that you have a working notebook instance in which you can clone the deployment repository.


Evaluation:

Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the deployment project rubric. Review this rubric thoroughly, and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must meet specifications for you to pass.
Project Submission

When you are ready to submit your project, collect all of the files in the project directory and compress them into a single archive for upload. In particular, make sure that the following files are included:

    * The SageMaker Project.ipynb file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.
    * An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook with the name report.html or report.pdf.
    * The completed train/train.py and serve/predict.py python files.
    * The edited website/index.html file.

Alternatively, your submission could consist of the GitHub link to your repository. THIS IS IT.
